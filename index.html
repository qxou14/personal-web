            Hello,
            I am an undergraduate student who majors in Computer Science at The City College of New York.
            I know many of today's top programming languages including Python, Java, C++, PHP, HTML/CSS
            and Javascrpit. Also, I have knowledge to some of the
            popular tools such as Django and React.

            Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Tarifica and my daily responsivity is related to data
            maintenance.

            <br>
            <br>
            I am an optimistic person,and I like to accept any kind of challenges.
            I joined a Wrestling team during my high school years because I heard people said Wrestling is very
            challenging.
            While I was on the team, I learned the mindset of never giving up regardless of any situation.
            Everything can be solved just by simply not giving up and working hard. In my personal time,
            I love to watch movies and listen to music. Sometimes I like to watch some algorithms videos on Youtube.
          </p>
